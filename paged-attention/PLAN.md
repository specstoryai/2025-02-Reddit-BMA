Phase 1: Basic Foundation
1. Create a basic visual model of the traditional KV cache approach
- Simple input sequence visualization (e.g., "The quick brown fox")
- Show how memory is allocated contiguously
- Demonstrate memory fragmentation problems
- Highlight wasted memory spaces

Phase 2: PagedAttention Model
1. Create parallel visualization of the paged approach
- Show same input sequence divided into blocks
- Demonstrate non-contiguous memory allocation
- Visualize block tables and mapping
- Show reduced memory waste

Phase 3: Interactive Components
1. Add step-by-step walkthrough functionality
- Forward/back buttons through process stages
- Highlight active components at each step
- Add explanatory tooltips/overlays

Phase 4: Comparison Features
1. Create side-by-side interactive comparison
- Synchronized stepping through both approaches
- Memory usage metrics display
- Efficiency comparisons
- Visual indicators of benefits/drawbacks

Phase 5: Educational Elements
1. Add instructional overlays
- Key concept explanations
- Visual guides to important components
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Common scenarios and examples

Phase 6: Advanced Features
1. Add interactive demonstrations of key concepts
- Memory block allocation/deallocation
- Copy-on-write mechanism
- Block sharing visualization
- Memory fragmentation scenarios

Phase 7: User Interaction Elements
1. Add user control features
- Custom input sequences
- Adjustable block sizes
- Different scenario selections
- Speed control for animations

Phase 8: Enhanced Visualizations
1. Add detailed memory state views
- Block allocation visualizations
- Memory usage graphs
- Efficiency metrics
- Performance comparisons

Phase 9: Documentation & Help
1. Create supporting materials
- How-to guides
- Concept explanations
- FAQ section
- Reference documentation

Phase 10: Polish & Refinement
1. Add finishing touches
- Visual styling improvements
- Performance optimizations
- User experience enhancements
- Mobile responsiveness

The app should maintain simplicity while effectively demonstrating the key advantages of PagedAttention. Each phase builds upon the previous one, gradually increasing complexity and understanding. Focus should be on clear visualization and interaction rather than implementing actual LLM functionality.
