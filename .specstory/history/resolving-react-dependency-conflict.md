## Resolving React Dependency Conflict (2/13/2025, 11:42:24 AM)

Help me resolve this issue for @backpacks

_**Assistant**_

The issue is a dependency conflict with React version 19.0.0 in your project, while several packages require React 18.x or lower. Let me check your package.json to provide the exact fix.

Read file: backpacks/package.json

The issue is that you're using React 19.0.0, but many of your dependencies (like @react-three/drei) require React 18.x. React 19 is still in alpha and not officially released, which is causing compatibility issues.

Let's fix this by downgrading to React 18. I'll edit your package.json:

---

_****_

```diff
      "next-themes": "^0.4.4",
      "pixi.js": "^8.8.0",
-     "react": "^19.0.0",
+     "react": "^18.2.0",
      "react-day-picker": "^8.10.1",
-     "react-dom": "^19.0.0",
+     "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
      "react-hook-form": "^7.54.2",
      "react-resizable-panels": "^2.1.7",
```

---

Now run:

---

_****_

```bash
cd backpacks && rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
```

```
npm error code ERESOLVE

We have another dependency conflict with date-fns. Let's fix that too:

---

_****_

```diff
      "clsx": "^2.1.1",
      "cmdk": "^1.0.0",
-     "date-fns": "^4.1.0",
+     "date-fns": "^2.30.0",
      "embla-carousel-react": "^8.5.2",
      "input-otp": "^1.4.2",
```

---

Now try installing again:

---

_****_

```bash
npm install
```

```
➜  backpacks git:(lukeskyfarter-backpacks) ✗ npm install
npm warn deprecated three-mesh-bvh@0.7.8: Deprecated due to three.js version incompatibility. Please use v0.

Great! The installation succeeded. You can now run your development server as usual. There's a warning about three-mesh-bvh but it shouldn't affect functionality. If you want to fix that later, you can upgrade to v0.8.0 of three-mesh-bvh.
