## Data Structure for Nudge Nudge App (2/13/2025, 4:31:18 PM)

_**User**_

OK, so I've got this Clojure web app. It's called "Nudge Nudge".

The idea is that a user types in their issue or dilema, and then they can choose a persona to get advice on what to do about it. They are presented the 9 personas in a fun/friendly grid  of boxes below. The box should anthropomorphize the perspective of the advice. If/when the user clicks the the perspective, we invoke an LLM with their issue and a prompt specific to that perspective, and get a short piece of advise back from the LLM.

We'll use Claude Sonnet 3.5 for the LLM.

Here are the 9 perspectives to show in the grid:

Socratic Method: Guides people to discover answers through systematic questioning and critical examination of their own beliefs and assumptions.
Deontology: Provides guidance based on universal moral rules and duties, focusing on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions regardless of consequences.
Utilitarianism: Advises actions that maximize well-being and happiness for the greatest number of people affected by a decision.
Psychotherapy: Helps people understand their deeper emotional patterns, past experiences, and unconscious motivations to resolve current issues.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Identifies and modifies unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors to improve emotional well-being and problem-solving abilities.
Zen Buddhist: Emphasizes mindful presence, acceptance of what is, and letting go of attachments to reduce suffering.
Existentialist: Empowers individuals to create meaning in their lives by embracing personal responsibility and authentic choices in the face of life's uncertainties.
Stoic: Teaches focusing on what's within our control while accepting external circumstances with equanimity and rational judgment.
Solution-Focused: Concentrates on building solutions and achieving desired future outcomes rather than analyzing past problems.

Put those in a data file for use in the app.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a data file for these perspectives. Based on the project structure shown in the README, we should create this in the `src/nudge` directory. I'll create a new file called `perspectives.clj` that will contain these perspectives as Clojure data structures.

First, let me check if the directory exists and create the file.

| üìÑ `handler.clj` |
| üìÑ `core.clj` |

</details>

Great, I'll create a new file called `perspectives.clj` in the `src/nudge` directory. I'll structure the data as a vector of maps, where each map contains the perspective's name and description. This will make it easy to use in the web app for both display and LLM prompting.

I've created a new file `src/nudge/perspectives.clj` that contains all nine perspectives in a Clojure data structure. For each perspective, I've included:

1. `:name` - The name of the perspective
2. `:description` - The full description you provided
3. `:icon` - A relevant emoji to visually represent each perspective in the grid
4. `:prompt-style` - A concise instruction for how the LLM should approach giving advice from this perspective

The data is structured as a vector of maps, which will make it easy to:
1. Iterate through the perspectives to create the grid display
2. Look up specific perspectives when needed
3. Access the prompt-style when making LLM calls

The icons I've chosen are meant to visually represent each perspective in a way that's both meaningful and friendly:
- ü§î Thinking face for Socratic Method (questioning)
- ‚öñÔ∏è Scales for Deontology (moral judgment)
- üåç World for Utilitarianism (collective good)
- üõãÔ∏è Couch for Psychotherapy (therapy sessions)
- üß† Brain for CBT (thought patterns)
- ‚òØÔ∏è Yin-yang for Zen Buddhist (balance)
- üîë Key for Existentialist (unlocking meaning)
- üèõÔ∏è Classical building for Stoic (ancient wisdom)
- üéØ Target for Solution-Focused (goal-oriented)

Would you like me to proceed with creating the web interface that will display these perspectives in a grid and handle the interaction with Claude?

Cool... OK, so now I need a route at `/` that presents the main UI. It should be stylish and fun. It should have the name of the app "Nudge Nudge" at the top. Big and bold and sassy and fun.

Below that should be a very welcoming big text area for the user to enter their issue, situation or dilema.

Then below that the 9 perspectives should be presented, with the info and as big, clickable inviting buttons.

Let's just do that much now, and not worry about the buttons doing anything yet when you click on them.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a stylish and fun UI for the main page. First, let me check the existing views and handler files to see how to best integrate this.

---

_****_

Read file: src/nudge/views.clj

---

_****_

Read file: src/nudge/handler.clj

---

_****_



Great! Now I'll create a new version of the views file that includes our stylish UI. We'll need to:
1. Require our perspectives namespace
2. Create a new layout with some nice styling
3. Create a new index page with the text area and perspective grid

I've created a stylish and modern UI for the main page! Here's what I've done:

1. Created a fun, bouncy title animation for "Nudge Nudge"
2. Added a welcoming subtitle
3. Created a large, inviting text area for users to enter their dilemma
4. Designed a responsive 3x3 grid of perspective cards
5. Added hover effects and animations for interactivity
6. Used a modern color scheme with a coral primary color (#FF6B6B)

The UI features:
- A large, animated title that bounces in when the page loads
- A friendly subtitle that invites users to share their dilemma
- A spacious text area with a placeholder message
- Beautiful perspective cards that:
  - Show the emoji icon large and centered
  - Display the perspective name
  - Show the description
  - Have a nice hover effect that lifts them up and adds a shadow
  - Have a subtle border that highlights on hover

The layout is responsive and will work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Each perspective card is clickable (though we haven't implemented the click handling yet, as requested).

Would you like me to start the server so you can see how it looks? Or would you like me to make any adjustments to the design?

getting this running `clj -M:dev` and hitting:

```2025-02-13 16:52:25.429:INFO::main: Logging initialized @3133ms to org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.StdErrLog
Execution error (FileNotFoundException) at nudge.handler/eval1924$loading (handler.clj:1).

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, we need to add the Ring middleware dependencies to the project. Let me check the `deps.edn` file to add them.

---

_****_

Read file: deps.edn

---

_****_



We need to add the Ring middleware dependency. Let me edit the `deps.edn` file to add it:

---

_****_

```diff
          ring/ring-core {:mvn/version "1.10.0"}
          ring/ring-jetty-adapter {:mvn/version "1.10.0"}
+         ring/ring-defaults {:mvn/version "0.4.0"}
          compojure/compojure {:mvn/version "1.7.0"}
          hiccup/hiccup {:mvn/version "2.0.0-alpha2"}}
```

---

_****_



Now let me check the core namespace to make sure we have everything set up correctly:

---

_****_

Read file: src/nudge/core.clj

---

_****_



The core namespace looks good, but we need to wrap our app with the Ring defaults middleware in the handler namespace. Let me update that:

---

_****_

```diff
              [nudge.views :as views]))
  
- (defroutes app-routes
+ (defroutes routes
    (GET "/" [] (views/index-page))
    (route/resources "/")
    (route/not-found (views/not-found-page)))
+ 
+ (def app-routes
+   (wrap-defaults routes site-defaults))
```

---

_****_



Now you should be able to run the server with `clj -M:dev`. The changes I made were:

1. Added the `ring/ring-defaults` dependency to `deps.edn`
2. Updated the handler namespace to properly wrap the routes with Ring's defaults middleware

Try running `clj -M:dev` again and visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see the stylish UI with:
- The bouncy "Nudge Nudge" title
- A text area for entering your dilemma
- A 3x3 grid of perspective cards with their icons and descriptions

Let me know if you run into any other issues or if you'd like to make any adjustments to the UI!

Give me a .gitignore fire that's typical for Cursor projects and that has anything this project needs ignored in it.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a `.gitignore` file with common patterns for Clojure projects, as well as Cursor-specific ignores:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ # Clojure
+ .cpcache/
+ .lein-*
+ .nrepl-port
+ .clj-kondo/.cache
+ .lsp/.cache
+ 
+ # Cursor and VS Code
+ .vscode/
+ .cursor/
+ .cursor-log/
+ .idea/
+ 
+ # Mac
+ .DS_Store
+ .AppleDouble
+ .LSOverride
+ 
+ # Logs and databases
+ *.log
+ *.sqlite
+ 
+ # Local environment files
+ .env
+ .env.local
+ 
+ # Build directories
+ target/
+ classes/
+ out/
+ 
+ # Dependency directories
+ node_modules/
+ 
+ # Temporary files
+ *.swp
+ *~
+ .*.swp
+ *.tmp 
```

---

_****_



I've created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that includes:

1. Clojure-specific patterns:
   - `.cpcache/` - Clojure's dependency cache
   - `.nrepl-port` - nREPL port file
   - `.clj-kondo/.cache` - Clj-kondo linter cache
   - `.lsp/.cache` - Language server cache

2. Cursor and IDE patterns:
   - `.cursor/` - Cursor IDE files
   - `.cursor-log/` - Cursor logs
   - `.vscode/` - VS Code settings (since Cursor is VS Code-based)
   - `.idea/` - IntelliJ IDEA files (common for Clojure development)

3. System files:
   - `.DS_Store` - Mac system files
   - Other Mac-specific hidden files

4. Common development patterns:
   - Build directories (`target/`, `classes/`, `out/`)
   - Environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`)
   - Log files and databases
   - Temporary files and editor backups

This should cover all the files and directories that shouldn't be tracked in your git repository. Let me know if you'd like me to add any additional patterns!

OK... now I need a lib to use Anthropic, and I need a local .env file to put in my API key. Handle this for me. I'll provide the API key in the file. Make sure .env is excluded from Git, and add the need for the .env with the key to the README.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you set this up. First, let's add the necessary dependency for making HTTP requests to the Anthropic API. We'll use `clj-http` for HTTP requests and `cheshire` for JSON handling.

---

_****_

```diff
          ring/ring-defaults {:mvn/version "0.4.0"}
          compojure/compojure {:mvn/version "1.7.0"}

+         environ/environ {:mvn/version "1.2.0"}}
  
   :aliases
```

Now let's create a template `.env` file that users can copy and fill in with their API key:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ # Anthropic API Key (Required)
+ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here 
```

---

_****_





Now let's update the README to include instructions about the API key requirement:

I've set up everything you need for Anthropic API integration:

1. Added necessary dependencies to `deps.edn`:
   - `clj-http` for making HTTP requests
   - `cheshire` for JSON handling
   - `environ` for environment variable management

2. Created `.env.template` as a template for the required environment variables
   - Users will copy this to `.env` and add their API key
   - `.env` is already in our `.gitignore`

3. Updated the README with:
   - Instructions for setting up the API key
   - Information about required environment variables
   - Updated dependency list
   - Added `.env.template` to the project structure

4. Created `src/nudge/anthropic.clj` with:
   - A function to safely access the API key from environment variables
   - A `generate-response` function that:
     - Takes a user's issue and a perspective map
     - Creates a system prompt based on the perspective
     - Makes the API call to Claude
     - Returns the generated advice

The API integration is ready to use. When you want to make a call to Claude, you'll just need to:
1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
2. Add your Anthropic API key to the `.env` file
3. Use the `nudge.anthropic/generate-response` function with the user's issue and chosen perspective

Would you like me to add anything else to the setup?

_**User**_

OK, now I want to provide the user with a sample situation they can click to use in case they don't have one handy to try out the app with. The sample situation is ""I've been at my current job for 5 years. Recently, I got offered a position at a new company that pays 25% more, but my current workplace feels safe and comfortable - I know everyone, I understand the systems, and my current boss is very supportive. The new job would be challenging and require learning new skills, plus there's some uncertainty about the company's culture. I'm torn between staying in my comfort zone versus taking a risk for better pay and potential growth. What should I do?" Put that in the app, and have it fill in the text box with it if they click that they want a sample scenario.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add this sample scenario to the views. We'll need to:
1. Add the sample text as a constant
2. Add a button to load the sample
3. Add some JavaScript to handle filling in the text area when clicked

I've added the sample scenario feature with these changes:

1. Added the sample scenario text as a constant `sample-scenario`
2. Added a "Try with a sample dilemma" button below the text area
3. Added styles for the button using our secondary color (teal)
4. Added JavaScript to handle loading the sample text when the button is clicked
5. The JavaScript also adjusts the textarea height to fit the content

The button is styled to:
- Be centered below the text area
- Have a teal background (our secondary color)
- Have a subtle hover effect with a shadow and slight lift
- Look inviting and clickable

The sample scenario is stored in a hidden input field and loaded into the textarea when the button is clicked. The JavaScript also handles resizing the textarea to fit the content automatically.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the button styling or placement? Or would you like to see how it looks running in the browser?

---

_**User**_

OK, but that sample button is a bit too prominent. Tone down the color to be not eye catching, and don't center it have it over on the right and above the text box.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the styling to make the sample button more subtle and reposition it above and to the right of the text box.

I've made the following changes to make the sample button more subtle:

1. Styling changes:
   - Changed the background to a light gray (#f0f0f0)
   - Changed text color to a subtle gray (#666)
   - Added a light border
   - Made the font slightly smaller (0.9rem)
   - Simplified the hover effect to just darken the background slightly
   - Removed the shadow and lift effects

2. Positioning changes:
   - Moved the button above the text area
   - Aligned it to the right with `margin: 0 0 0.5rem auto`
   - Added a small bottom margin to space it from the text area

3. Text change:
   - Shortened the text from "Try with a sample dilemma" to "Try a sample dilemma" to make it more concise

The button now looks more like a utility feature rather than a primary action, and its position above the text area makes it less prominent while still being easily discoverable.

Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the styling or positioning?

_**User**_

OK, so let's hand hold the user a bit, and handle the case where they click one of the 9 perspective buttons and they don't have any text in the text area yet. Have it return focus to the text area, and ask them to enter their issue first. Show it in a nice, friendly, funny and attractive way.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add a friendly validation message that appears when they click a perspective without entering text. We'll make it appear below the text area in a fun, bouncy way.

I've added a friendly validation message that appears when someone clicks a perspective without entering text. Here's what I've done:

1. Added a fun, bouncy validation message that:
   - Has a waving hand emoji üëã
   - Uses friendly, casual language: "Oops! Mind sharing your situation first? No judgment here ‚Äì we're all ears!"
   - Appears with a bouncy animation
   - Has a subtle pink background (matching our primary color theme)
   - Automatically disappears after 5 seconds

2. Added animations:
   - The message bounces in using a playful cubic-bezier curve
   - The hand emoji waves continuously with a gentle rotation animation
   - The message fades in and scales up smoothly

3. Added validation handling:
   - Checks if the textarea is empty when a perspective is clicked
   - Prevents the default action if it's empty
   - Shows the validation message
   - Automatically focuses the textarea
   - Hides the message after 5 seconds

4. Styled the message to be:
   - Centered below the textarea
   - Friendly and noticeable without being annoying
   - Consistent with our app's design language

The result is a gentle, friendly nudge that guides users without being intrusive or annoying. Would you like me to adjust anything about the message or its behavior?

_**User**_

Perfect... OK, now we need to get to the real work. When the user clicks one of the perspective buttons, it needs to use JavaScript to make an async call back to the server. The perspective button should animate in an attractive, fun, exciting and funny way to let the user know the system is working to get them their advice... there should be 6 or so made up activities the perspective is doing to get them their advice. The activities should be appropriate to the perspective. After the response comes back from the server, it should replace the perspective with the content for the user to read. It should be attractively presented and easy to read. After that, the button should no longer be clickable, but the other perspectives should be clickable so the user can get more than 1 perspective and compare them.

For now let's NOT actually invoke Claude yet. We'll do that next. Just use a made up response so I can see the UI working. But do have the response really come from invoking the server asynchronously.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create this interactive experience. We'll need to:
1. Add a new server endpoint for getting advice
2. Create animations and loading states for the perspective cards
3. Add async JavaScript to handle the interaction
4. Style the response presentation

Let's start with updating the handler and views:

I've created a fun and interactive experience for getting advice. Here's what happens now:

1. When a user clicks a perspective card (after entering their issue):
   - The card enters a loading state
   - The original content is saved
   - A series of 6 themed loading messages cycle through every 1.5 seconds
   - Each perspective has its own unique set of loading messages that match its character

2. The loading messages are fun and thematic:
   - Socratic Method: "ü§î Formulating probing questions...", "üéØ Identifying core assumptions..."
   - Zen Buddhist: "üßò Entering mindful state...", "‚òØÔ∏è Aligning with present moment..."
   - CBT: "üß† Mapping thought patterns...", "üìù Analyzing behavior chains..."
   - etc.

3. While loading:
   - The card pulses gently
   - Loading messages fade in/out smoothly
   - The card becomes non-interactive
   - Other cards remain clickable

4. After the response comes back:
   - The loading animation stops
   - The advice fades in smoothly
   - The text is formatted for easy reading
   - The card becomes non-interactive permanently
   - Other cards remain available for more perspectives

5. If there's an error:
   - The card reverts to its original state
   - A friendly error message appears
   - The user can try again

The mock server response has a 3-second delay to show off the loading states, and returns a sample stoic response. Each perspective's loading states are unique and reflect their philosophical approach, making the waiting time entertaining and educational.

Would you like me to adjust anything about the animations, timing, or presentation? Or would you like to try it out and see how it works?

---

_**User**_

OK, that's good, except the size of the response changes the size of the perspective button and stretches it out. Let's have it scroll instead of change size. Also the user won't neccessarily remember which perspective it was, so keep the perspective name, just lose the icon and description.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the styles and response presentation to keep a consistent card size and maintain the perspective name. We'll make the advice content scrollable and keep the perspective name at the top.

I've made several improvements to the card presentation:

1. Fixed Card Size:
   - Set a consistent height (280px) for all perspective cards
   - Used flexbox to maintain proper internal spacing
   - Added scrolling for advice content that exceeds the card height

2. Advice Presentation:
   - Kept the perspective name at the top
   - Added a subtle border below the name to separate it from the advice
   - Made the advice section scrollable with a max height
   - Added styled scrollbars (thin and matching our color scheme)

3. Scrollbar Styling:
   - Added custom scrollbar styling for both modern (scrollbar-width) and WebKit browsers
   - Used our primary color for the scrollbar thumb
   - Added rounded corners and proper sizing

4. Layout:
   - Removed the icon and description when showing advice
   - Kept the perspective name prominent at the top
   - Added proper padding and margins for better readability

The cards will now:
1. Stay the same size regardless of content length
2. Show a scrollbar when content exceeds the card height
3. Keep the perspective name visible at all times
4. Have a consistent, clean look across all states

Would you like me to adjust any of the sizing or styling?

_**User**_

You broke it:

```Uncaught SyntaxError: redeclaration of formal parameter perspectiveNamelocalhost:3000:244:13note: Previously declared at line 239, column 54```

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, I see the issue. In the `getAdvice` function, I'm redeclaring `perspectiveName` which is already a parameter. Let me fix that:

---

_****_

```diff
        let currentState = 0;
  
-       // Save perspective name for later
-       const perspectiveName = perspectiveCard.querySelector('.perspective-name').textContent;
+       // Save original content for error case
+       const originalContent = perspectiveCard.innerHTML;
  
        // Add loading class
```

---

_****_



I've fixed the JavaScript error by:
1. Removing the redundant `perspectiveName` declaration since it's already passed as a parameter
2. Restored the `originalContent` save for the error case

The code should now work correctly, maintaining the perspective name in the card and properly handling both success and error cases. Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the functionality?

_**User**_

OK, now we need to replace the mock response with a real request to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Use the API key from our .env file. Tell Claude that the user has the situation they input, and that they are looking for concrete advice on specifically what to do, but from the very specific perspective. Provide both the name and description of the perspective that we have. Tell it you want the advice grounded in that perspective. Return the response rather than the mock response.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a new namespace for the Claude API interaction and update the handler to use it. First, let's create the Claude service:

```

Now let's update the handler to use this new Claude service:

+         (get-advice (:issue params) (:perspective params))))))
    (route/resources "/")
    (route/not-found (views/not-found-page)))
```

---

_****_



I've made the following changes:

1. Created a new `claude.clj` namespace that:
   - Handles the Claude API interaction
   - Gets the API key from the environment
   - Formats the prompt to emphasize the perspective's approach
   - Makes the API call to Claude
   - Extracts the response text

2. Updated `handler.clj` to:
   - Remove the mock response
   - Add a function to look up perspective details by name
   - Use the Claude service to generate real advice
   - Handle cases where the perspective isn't found

The prompt to Claude is structured to:
- Identify its role as an advisor from the specific perspective
- Include both the name and description of the perspective
- Request concrete, actionable advice
- Ask for responses grounded in the philosophical/therapeutic approach
- Keep responses concise but impactful

The system will now:
1. Get the user's issue and chosen perspective
2. Look up the full perspective details
3. Send a well-structured prompt to Claude
4. Return the actual AI-generated advice

The loading animations will now show while we wait for the real Claude response instead of the artificial delay.

Would you like me to adjust anything about how we're prompting Claude or handling the responses?

Ah yes, we need to add a library to load the `.env` file. The `environ` library doesn't automatically load from `.env` files - we need to add `dotenv` for that. Let's add it to our dependencies and set it up:

---

_****_

```diff
          clj-http/clj-http {:mvn/version "3.12.3"}
          cheshire/cheshire {:mvn/version "5.12.0"}
-         environ/environ {:mvn/version "1.2.0"}}
+         environ/environ {:mvn/version "1.2.0"}
+         lynxeyes/dotenv {:mvn/version "1.1.0"}}
  
   :aliases
```

---

_****_





Now let's update the core namespace to load the `.env` file when the application starts:

---

_****_

```diff
    (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]
              [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]
+             [dotenv :refer [env load-env]]
              [nudge.handler :as handler])
    (:gen-class))
  
  (defn start-server [port]
+   (load-env)  ; Load environment variables from .env file
    (jetty/run-jetty #'app {:port port
                            :join? false}))
```

---

_****_





Now let's update the Claude service to use the correct header name for the API key:

---

_****_

```diff
                            "Keep your response concise but impactful.")
          response (http/post api-url
-                            {:headers {"x-api-key" (get-api-key)
+                            {:headers {"x-api-key" (str "Bearer " (get-api-key))
                                      "anthropic-version" "2023-06-01"
                                      "content-type" "application/json"}
```

---

_****_





I've made these changes:

1. Added the `dotenv` library to load `.env` files
2. Updated `core.clj` to load the `.env` file when the server starts
3. Updated the Claude service to use the correct authorization header format with "Bearer "

Now when you restart the server with `clj -M:dev`, it should:
1. Load the `.env` file
2. Make the environment variables available through `environ`
3. Successfully authenticate with the Claude API

The error you were seeing should be resolved. Would you like me to make any other adjustments to how we're handling the environment variables or API authentication?

load-env does not exist

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, the namespace for dotenv is incorrect. Let's fix the core namespace to use the correct namespace and function:

---

_****_

```diff
    (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]
              [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]
-             [dotenv :refer [env load-env]]
+             [dotenv.core :refer [load-dotenv]]
              [nudge.handler :as handler])
    (:gen-class))
  
  (defn start-server [port]
-   (load-env)  ; Load environment variables from .env file
+   (load-dotenv)  ; Load environment variables from .env file
    (jetty/run-jetty #'app {:port port
                            :join? false}))
```

---

_****_



I've fixed the namespace issue by:
1. Changed `[dotenv :refer [env load-env]]` to `[dotenv.core :refer [load-dotenv]]`
2. Updated the function call from `load-env` to `load-dotenv`

Now try running `clj -M:dev` again. The server should properly load the `.env` file and make the API key available to the application.

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I apologize - I made a mistake with the dotenv library. Let's use a different, more commonly used library called `clojure.java-time`. Let me update the dependencies and code:

---

_****_

```diff
          cheshire/cheshire {:mvn/version "5.12.0"}
          environ/environ {:mvn/version "1.2.0"}

+         io.github.cdimascio/dotenv-java {:mvn/version "3.0.0"}}
  
   :aliases
```

---

_****_





Now let's update the core namespace to use this library:

---

_****_

```diff
    (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]
              [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]
-             [dotenv.core :refer [load-dotenv]]
              [nudge.handler :as handler])
+   (:import [io.github.cdimascio.dotenv Dotenv])
    (:gen-class))
  
        wrap-reload))
  
+ (defn load-dotenv []
+   (-> (Dotenv/configure)
+       (.ignoreIfMissing)
+       (.load)))
+ 
  (defn start-server [port]
    (load-dotenv)  ; Load environment variables from .env file
```

---

_****_





And let's update the Claude service to use the correct way to access environment variables with this library:

---

_****_

```diff
  (ns nudge.claude
    (:require [clj-http.client :as http]
-             [cheshire.core :as json]
-             [environ.core :refer [env]]))
+             [cheshire.core :as json])
+   (:import [io.github.cdimascio.dotenv Dotenv]))
  
  (def ^:private api-url "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages")
  
+ (def ^:private dotenv
+   (-> (Dotenv/configure)
+       (.ignoreIfMissing)
+       (.load)))
+ 
  (defn- get-api-key []
-   (or (env :anthropic-api-key)
+   (or (.get dotenv "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
        (throw (ex-info "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found in environment"
                       {:type :missing-api-key}))))
```

---

_****_





I've made these changes:

1. Switched to using `dotenv-java` library which is more reliable and widely used
2. Updated the core namespace to properly load the .env file
3. Updated the Claude service to use the new way of accessing environment variables
4. Removed the unused environ dependency references

Now when you run `clj -M:dev`, it should:
1. Load the .env file properly
2. Find your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in the environment
3. Use it correctly in the API calls

The error you were seeing should be resolved. Would you like me to make any other adjustments to how we're handling the environment variables?

This is way too much overkill. Get rid of this lib stuff. Just read the .env file using file IO directly man!

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right - let's just read the file directly. Much simpler!

          response (http/post api-url
-                            {:headers {"x-api-key" (str "Bearer " (get-api-key))
+                            {:headers {"x-api-key" (get-api-key)
                                      "anthropic-version" "2023-06-01"
                                      "content-type" "application/json"}
```

---

_****_





And let's clean up the core namespace since we don't need the dotenv stuff anymore:

---

_****_

```diff
              [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]
              [nudge.handler :as handler])
-   (:import [io.github.cdimascio.dotenv Dotenv])
    (:gen-class))
  
        wrap-reload))
  
- (defn load-dotenv []
-   (-> (Dotenv/configure)
-       (.ignoreIfMissing)
-       (.load)))
- 
  (defn start-server [port]
-   (load-dotenv)  ; Load environment variables from .env file
    (jetty/run-jetty #'app {:port port
                            :join? false}))
```

---

_****_





Much better! Now we:
1. Simply read the .env file directly using `slurp`
2. Parse it into a map, ignoring comments and blank lines
3. Cache the env vars in a private var
4. No extra dependencies or Java version issues to deal with

The code is simpler and more straightforward. Try running `clj -M:dev` again and it should work with your .env file now. Let me know if you need any adjustments!

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. The Claude API format has changed - it wants the system prompt as a top-level parameter rather than as a message. Let me fix the API call format:

---

_****_

```diff
                                     {:model "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"

+                                     :messages [{:role "user"
                                                :content issue}]})
                              :as :json})]
```

---

_****_





I've updated the API call format to:
1. Move the system prompt to a top-level `system` parameter
2. Keep only the user message in the `messages` array

This matches the current Claude API format. Try it now and it should work correctly. Let me know if you need any other adjustments!

_**User**_

OK, last step... we don't want to bias the user by the placement of the 9 perspectives, so rather than them being in a fixed order let's randomize them for each load of the page so they appear in random order.

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the index-page function to shuffle the perspectives before displaying them:
