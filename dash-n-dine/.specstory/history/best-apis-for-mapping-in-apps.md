what's a great API to use for mapping in this app?

_**Assistant**_

For mapping functionality in web applications, here are some popular and reliable options:

1. **Google Maps JavaScript API**
- Industry standard with extensive features
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Rich ecosystem of additional services (Places, Directions, etc.)
- Drawback: Requires credit card for API key, though has generous free tier

2. **Mapbox**
- Beautiful customizable maps
- Great performance
- Strong developer tools
- More affordable than Google Maps for high volume
- Excellent for custom styling

3. **OpenStreetMap + Leaflet**
- Completely free and open-source
- Lightweight
- Great community
- No API key required for basic usage
- Perfect for simpler mapping needs

4. **HERE Maps**
- Good alternative to Google Maps
- Strong in automotive and enterprise use cases
- Generous free tier
- Good documentation

My recommendation would depend on your specific needs:
- For a professional app with standard mapping needs: **Google Maps**
- For beautiful custom maps with good pricing: **Mapbox**
- For an open-source solution or simple mapping: **Leaflet with OpenStreetMap**

Would you like me to provide implementation examples for any of these options?
