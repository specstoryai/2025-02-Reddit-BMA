Tomorrow team SpecsStory wants to have some fun and we're teaming up to build as many working prototypes as possible in 8 hrs for the first-ever "[Build Me Anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1io14r6/build_me_anything_challenge_3_devs_8_hours_your/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)" challenge! 

Think "Draw Me Anything" meets speed-composing ‚ú® meets chaos.

When:

Kicks off: Thursday, February 13th at 9 AM ET

Wraps up: 5 PM ET

We need your help!:

Drop your app idea in 1 - 2 sentences

We'll spend exactly 1 hour on each (constraints breed both creativity and fairness)

What you can expect:

A complete SpecStory share including a quick 1-2 minute video demo of where we got, a GitHub repo with all the code and every prompt we used (to see how we think).

We'll be updating comments on this post with links to all completed builds throughout the day

The Math:

3 folks √ó 60-minute builds √ó 8 hours = ü§Ø Very Optimistically we'll tackle up to 24 projects! 

The Rules:

Keep requests fun (remember, 60 mins!)

Safe for work pretty please (keep it clean!)

Limit 1 request per Redditor

We'll reply and comment to confirm if your request makes the cut

Drop your requests below! We'll start assigning them to the team and get building at 9 AM ET sharp! ‚è∞
