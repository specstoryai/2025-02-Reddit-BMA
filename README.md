**Title:** 🚀 Build Me Anything Challenge: 3 Devs, 8 Hours, Your Ideas → Working Prototypes LIVE (Thursday 2/13, 9 AM ET)


<details>
  
Tomorrow team [SpecsStory](https://specstory.com/) wants to have some fun and we're teaming up to build as many working prototypes as possible in 8 hrs **for the first-ever "Build Me Anything" challenge!** 

*Think "Draw Me Anything" meets speed-composing* ✨ *meets chaos.*

**When:**

* **Kicks off**: Thursday, February 13th at 9 AM ET
* **Wraps up:** 5 PM ET

**We need your help!:**

* Drop your app idea in 1 - 2 sentences
* We'll spend exactly 1 hour on each (*constraints* breed both creativity and fairness)

**What you can expect:**

* A complete [SpecStory share](https://docs.specstory.com/quickstart#share-your-history) including a quick 1-2 minute video demo of where we got, a GitHub repo with all the code and every prompt we used (to see how we think).
   * *We'll be updating comments on this post with links to all completed builds throughout the day*

**The Math:**

* 3 folks × 60-minute builds × 8 hours = 🤯 *Very Optimistically* we'll tackle up to 24 projects! 

**The Rules:**

* Keep requests fun (remember, 60 mins!)
* Safe for work pretty please (keep it clean!)
* Limit 1 request per Redditor
* We'll reply and comment to confirm if your request makes the cut

**Drop your requests below! We'll start assigning them to the team and get building at 9 AM ET sharp! ⏰**
