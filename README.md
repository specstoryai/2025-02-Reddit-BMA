Tomorrow team¬†[SpecsStory](https://specstory.com/)¬†wants to have some fun and we're teaming up to build as many working prototypes as possible in 8 hrs¬†**for the first-ever "Build Me Anything" challenge!**¬†

**What you can expect:**

* A complete [SpecStory share](https://docs.specstory.com/quickstart#share-your-history) including a quick 1-2 minute video demo of where we got, a GitHub repo with all the code and every prompt we used (to see how we think).
   * *We'll be updating comments on this post with links to all completed builds throughout the day*

**The Math:**

* 3 folks √ó 60-minute builds √ó 8 hours =¬†ü§Ø *Very Optimistically*¬†we'll tackle up to 24 projects!¬†

**The Rules:**
