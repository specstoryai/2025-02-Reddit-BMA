I'll help you create a Python virtual environment for your project on macOS. Here are the steps:

1. First, open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then run these commands:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Verify the virtual environment is activated - you should see (venv) at the start of your prompt
which python
```

After activation, you can install any required packages using pip. To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done working on your project, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```

Pro tips:
1. Add `venv/` to your `.gitignore` file if you're using git
2. Create a `requirements.txt` file to track your project dependencies:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

To install dependencies from requirements.txt (when sharing the project):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The virtual environment helps isolate your project dependencies from your global Python installation, making it easier to manage different projects with different package versions.
