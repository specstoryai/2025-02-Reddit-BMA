## Reddit Meme Template Search Script (2/13/2025, 4:02:48 PM)

_**User**_

ok. now I need a python script that uses the Reddit API (figure out a good library) to search r/MemeTemplatesOfficial for a given meme text (input on the command line) and returns the link to the first post in the results.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a Python script that uses the Reddit API to search for meme templates. We'll use PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) as it's the most popular and well-maintained Reddit API library.

First, let me check if there are any existing Python files in the workspace that might be relevant.

---

_**Assistant**_

_**Assistant**_



Let's create a new directory called `scripts` to store our Python script. I'll create a script that:
1. Uses PRAW to interact with Reddit
2. Takes a search query as a command line argument
3. Searches r/MemeTemplatesOfficial
4. Returns the URL of the first matching post

---

_**Assistant**_

```
mkdir -p scripts
```

---

_**Assistant**_



Now, I'll create a Python script that implements the Reddit search functionality. Note that you'll need to set up a Reddit application to get the necessary credentials. I'll include instructions in the comments.

---

_**Assistant**_

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import sys
import praw
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

def setup_reddit():
    """
    Set up the Reddit API client using credentials from environment variables.
    To set this up:
    1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
    2. Click 'create another app...' at the bottom
    3. Select 'script'
    4. Fill in name and description
    5. Set redirect uri to http://localhost:8080
    6. Create a .env file with:
        REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
        REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
        REDDIT_USER_AGENT=python:meme-template-searcher:v1.0 (by /u/your_username)
    """
    try:
        client_id = os.getenv('REDDIT_CLIENT_ID')
        client_secret = os.getenv('REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET')
        user_agent = os.getenv('REDDIT_USER_AGENT')

        if not all([client_id, client_secret, user_agent]):
            print("Error: Missing Reddit API credentials in .env file")
            print("Please set REDDIT_CLIENT_ID, REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET, and REDDIT_USER_AGENT")
            sys.exit(1)

        return praw.Reddit(
            client_id=client_id,
            client_secret=client_secret,
            user_agent=user_agent
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error setting up Reddit client: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

def search_meme_template(query):
    """Search r/MemeTemplatesOfficial for a meme template."""
    reddit = setup_reddit()
    subreddit = reddit.subreddit('MemeTemplatesOfficial')
    
    try:
        # Search the subreddit
        for submission in subreddit.search(query, sort='relevance', limit=1):
            # Return the URL of the first result
            return submission.url
        
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error searching Reddit: {e}")
        return None

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python search_meme_template.py 'your search query'")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    # Combine all arguments into a single search query
    search_query = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])
    
    result = search_meme_template(search_query)
    if result:
        print(f"Found template: {result}")
    else:
        print("No matching template found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

_**Assistant**_



Now, let's create a requirements.txt file to specify the required Python packages:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
praw==7.7.1
python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

---

_**Assistant**_



Let me explain how to use this script:

1. First, you'll need to set up your Reddit API credentials:
   - Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
   - Click "create another app..." at the bottom
   - Select "script"
   - Fill in a name and description
   - Set the redirect URI to http://localhost:8080
   - After creating the app, you'll get a client ID and client secret

2. Create a `.env` file in the `scripts` directory with your credentials:
```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=python:meme-template-searcher:v1.0 (by /u/your_username)
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x search_meme_template.py
```

5. Run the script with your search query:
```bash
./search_meme_template.py "your search query"
```

The script will return the URL of the first matching meme template from r/MemeTemplatesOfficial. If no matches are found, it will let you know.

Would you like me to help you set up the `.env` file with your Reddit API credentials?

it's just a subreddit search. figure out a way to do it without auth. here's some info

How to do a reddit search using API ? Not a subreddit search
Reddit API
The GUI search documentation for reddit (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search/) says that it is possible to do a reddit search and retrieve Posts, Comments and Subreddits related to the search term.

Is there anyway to do something similar using the API? I've gone through PRAW but it only shows how to search within a Subreddit. What I want is to search reddit using API and retrieve Posts, Comments and Subreddits related to the search term.

Hope I've been able to explain my problem clearly :) I'm very bad in explaining things

The API documentation is here. You can search subreddits and posts, but comments aren’t available to search via the public API.

I'm not sure how to do it with praw (maybe set the subreddit to "all") but you can hit this endpoint manually: https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=mysearchterm

Alternatively, you could try using the Pushbullet API for more advanced queries.

Strangely, I don't see this endpoint even in Reddit's official API documentation. The closest thing I found was this - https://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_search - a search endpoint but even that insists for a subreddit.

Am I missing anything? Sorry if I'm asking basic questions. I'm a newbie to reddit API

Thank you for your response. Really appreciate it brother! :)

So one thing you'll quickly learn about the Reddit API is that a decent amount of it is undocumented.

A lot of the regular website endpoints do allow you to simply append .json to receive a JSON response. That's how I found the search endpoint. I went to the regular Reddit search box, made a search, and then added .json to the end of the URL. https://www.reddit.com/search?q=test&sort=relevance&t=all

What do you mean by this? You added .json WHERE and to the end of what URL?

For example, you can view this very post as json just by appending .json to the url of this post.

Like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/z10wzz/how_to_do_a_reddit_search_using_api_not_a.json

Just make sure you open the URL in a browser. If it opens in a Reddit mobile app then it likely won't work.

I know this likely needs a new thread, but why does this search work:

https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/search/?q=%22You%20have%20awarded%201%20point%20to%20JetCarson%22%20&restrict_sr=1&type=comment&t=all

But, a similar search API call does not work? Alternately, can the search above be converted to a JSON response?

Hm yeah, you can append .json after "search" in your URL but it doesn't seem to maintain the subreddit filter. I'm not sure if there's an alternative query parameter that can be used instead. Like you mention, it might be worth a new thread for better visibility.

API Documentation
API Rules

Client Libraries
Info
To report a security issue with reddit, please send an email to whitehats@reddit.com .

Rules
1
Relevance
Posts must directly relate to Reddit's API, API libraries, or Reddit's source code. Ideas for changes belong in r/ideasfortheadmins; bug reports should be posted to r/bugs; general Reddit questions should be made in r/help; and requests for bots should be made to r/requestabot.

2
Unproductive response
Comments should be productive and helpful, not condescending. If you can't help answer someone's question or direct them to an appropriate subreddit, you should not comment at all.

3
Language specific
Posts should not ask questions that could otherwise be answered in a language-specific subreddit. For example, questions like, "how do I install PRAW?" are better asked in r/learnpython, as the question can be generalized to, "how do I install a package?".

4
Not a testing ground
r/redditdev is not the right place to test your bots & scripts. Please create your own private subreddit, or use r/test.

5
Asking for help
While we understand that many people are new to programming, when asking for help online (in any forum!) you must always always include your code, explain how it works, what the problem is, what you tried, and why it didn't work. This is similar to how you wouldn't walk into a mechanic and expect "hey my car isn't working, what gives?" to be enough to diagnose your problem. The more detail, the more likely you'll get your question answered. Low-effort questions will be removed.

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see! Yes, we can simplify this significantly by using Reddit's public JSON API endpoint without any authentication. I'll modify the script to use direct HTTP requests instead of PRAW.

---

_**Assistant**_

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys
import requests
import urllib.parse

def search_meme_template(query):
    """Search r/MemeTemplatesOfficial for a meme template using Reddit's public JSON API."""
    # URL encode the search query
    encoded_query = urllib.parse.quote(query)
    
    # Construct the search URL for r/MemeTemplatesOfficial
    url = f"https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial/search.json?q={encoded_query}&restrict_sr=1&sort=relevance&limit=1"
    
    try:
        # Add a User-Agent header to be nice to Reddit's servers
        headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'}
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        data = response.json()
        
        # Check if we have any results
        posts = data.get('data', {}).get('children', [])
        if posts:
            # Get the URL from the first post
            post_url = posts[0]['data'].get('url')
            return post_url
        
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error searching Reddit: {e}")
        return None

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python search_meme_template.py 'your search query'")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    # Combine all arguments into a single search query
    search_query = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])
    
    result = search_meme_template(search_query)
    if result:
        print(f"Found template: {result}")
    else:
        print("No matching template found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now let's update the requirements.txt file to only include the requests library since we no longer need PRAW:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
requests==2.31.0
```

---

_**Assistant**_



The script has been completely simplified! Now you can use it without any authentication. Here's how to use it:

1. Install the required package:
```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script with your search query:
```bash
python search_meme_template.py "your search query"
```

The script will:
1. Take your search query from the command line
2. Search r/MemeTemplatesOfficial using Reddit's public JSON API
3. Return the URL of the first matching post
4. No authentication or API keys needed!

The script uses Reddit's public JSON API endpoint by appending `.json` to the search URL, as mentioned in the discussion you shared. This is much simpler than using PRAW and doesn't require any authentication.

Would you like to try it out with a test search query?

---

_**User**_

the URL i was hoping you'd return is the reddit post url like this: @https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial/comments/16zqjwq/success_kid_uncropped/ 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see! You want the actual Reddit post URL rather than the direct image URL. I'll modify the script to return the permalink URL instead.

---

_**Assistant**_

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def search_meme_template(query):
    """Search r/MemeTemplatesOfficial for a meme template using Reddit's public JSON API."""

    # Construct the search URL for r/MemeTemplatesOfficial
    url = f"https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial/search.json?q={encoded_query}&restrict_sr=1&sort=relevance&limit=1"
    
    try:
        # Add a User-Agent header to be nice to Reddit's servers
        headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'}
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        data = response.json()
        
        # Check if we have any results
        posts = data.get('data', {}).get('children', [])
        if posts:
            # Get the permalink (post URL) from the first post
            permalink = posts[0]['data'].get('permalink')
            if permalink:
                # Convert relative URL to absolute URL
                post_url = f"https://www.reddit.com{permalink}"
                return post_url
        
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error searching Reddit: {e}")
        return None

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:

    result = search_meme_template(search_query)
    if result:
        print(f"Found template: {result}")
    else:
        print("No matching template found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

_**Assistant**_



Now the script will return the Reddit post URL (like https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial/comments/...) instead of the direct image URL. The post URL will allow users to see the full context, comments, and other information about the template.

For example, if you search for "success kid", you'll get a URL similar to the format you provided (https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial/comments/...).

Would you like to try it out with a test search?

---

_**User**_

cool. now also download the first main image of that first matching reddit post.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the script to also download the image from the first matching post. We'll use the original 'url' field for the image download since that typically points to the image file directly.

I've updated the script to:

1. Add a new `download_image` function that:
   - Creates a `downloaded_templates` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Downloads the image and saves it with its original filename
   - Falls back to 'template.jpg' if the filename can't be determined
   - Handles the download in chunks for better memory usage

2. Modified the `search_meme_template` function to:
   - Return both the post URL and image information
   - Check if the URL ends with common image extensions before attempting to download
   - Download the image if it's a valid image URL

3. Updated the output to show:
   - The Reddit post URL
   - The local path where the image was downloaded
   - The original image URL

Now when you run the script:
```bash
python search_meme_template.py "your search query"
```

It will:
1. Find the first matching post in r/MemeTemplatesOfficial
2. Show you the Reddit post URL
3. Download the image to a `downloaded_templates` folder
4. Show you where the image was saved

The images will be saved in a `downloaded_templates` directory in the same folder as the script. Each image will keep its original filename from Reddit (or use 'template.jpg' as a fallback).

Would you like to try it out with a test search?

I've added detailed progress output throughout the script. Now when you run it, you'll see:

1. Initial search information:
   - The search query being used
   - The full Reddit search URL
   - Progress of the Reddit API request

2. Search results processing:
   - Number of posts found
   - The post URL when found
   - The image URL when found
   - Whether the URL appears to be a direct image link

3. Image download progress:
   - The source URL
   - Creation of output directory if needed
   - Filename detection and selection
   - Download progress
   - Save location

4. Final results with checkmarks (✓) for successes and an X (✗) for failures

The output is now wrapped in clear section markers (===) to make it easier to read.

Try running it with a search query like:
```bash
python search_meme_template.py "success kid"
```

You'll see detailed progress information at each step of the process!

if its an imgur you need to write some special code to download the actual image file

Ah yes, good catch! Imgur URLs can be tricky because they might not end in an image extension but still be images. Let me add special handling for Imgur URLs.

no. they do end in an image extension, but they're html with the image in it instead of the image driectly

I've added a new `get_direct_image_url` function that:
1. Checks if the URL is from Imgur
2. If it's already a direct `i.imgur.com` URL, leaves it as is
3. If it's a regular `imgur.com` URL, converts it to use `i.imgur.com` instead
4. Returns the original URL for non-Imgur URLs

The main changes are:
1. Added the new function to handle Imgur URL conversion
2. Modified the search function to convert Imgur URLs to direct image URLs before downloading
3. Added verbose output to show when we're converting an Imgur URL

Now when the script encounters an Imgur URL like:
```
https://imgur.com/something.jpg
```

It will convert it to:
```
https://i.imgur.com/something.jpg
```

This ensures we get the actual image file instead of the HTML page. The script will now handle both regular image URLs and Imgur URLs correctly!

I've made several improvements to handle Imgur's rate limiting and ensure we get the actual image instead of HTML:

1. Added proper browser-like headers including:
   - `Accept` header to indicate we want images
   - `Referer` header pointing to imgur.com
   - `Accept-Language` and other standard browser headers

2. Added retry logic with exponential backoff:
   - Will try up to 3 times if the download fails
   - Waits longer between each retry (1s, 2s, 4s)
   - Shows detailed progress of retry attempts

3. Added content-type checking:
   - Verifies we actually got an image and not HTML
   - If we get HTML, it will retry with backoff
   - Shows clear error messages about content type issues

This should now handle Imgur's rate limiting and ensure we get the actual image file instead of HTML. The exponential backoff also helps avoid hitting rate limits too quickly.

Would you like to try the script again with these improvements?

I've made the following changes:

1. Added a `sanitize_filename` function that:
   - Converts spaces to underscores
   - Makes everything lowercase
   - Removes any characters that aren't alphanumeric, dash, or underscore
   - This ensures we get a valid filename on all operating systems

2. Modified the `download_image` function to:
   - Take the search query as a parameter
   - Keep the file extension from the original image
   - Use the sanitized search query as the base filename
   - Fall back to 'template' if the sanitized query is empty

3. Updated the image download call in `search_meme_template` to pass the query parameter

Now when you run:
```bash
python search_meme_template.py "success kid"
```

The image will be saved as `success_kid.jpg` (or whatever the original extension was) instead of using the Imgur filename.

For example:
- `"success kid"` → `success_kid.jpg`
- `"Drake Hotline Bling"` → `drake_hotline_bling.jpg`
- `"Distracted Boyfriend!!!"` → `distracted_boyfriend.jpg`

The script maintains the original file extension to preserve the image format but uses your search query as the base filename.

---

_**User**_

update the script to allow it to take in a memes.json file like this: @memes.json and for the ones where the image_url isn't specified or where the image_url contains the text "placeholder" run the search and download to get an image and update the JSON with an image_url relative path to that downloaded image. Wait 1 second between each meme to avoid rate limits.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the script to process the memes.json file and update it with downloaded image URLs. I'll add a new function to handle this batch processing.

_**Assistant**_





I've added a new `process_memes_json` function that:

1. Takes a path to a memes.json file
2. Reads the JSON and processes each meme in the array
3. For each meme:
   - Checks if the image_url is missing or contains "placeholder"
   - If so, searches for and downloads the meme template
   - Updates the JSON with the relative path to the downloaded image
   - Waits 1 second between downloads to avoid rate limits
4. Saves the updated JSON back to the same file

The script can now be used in two ways:

1. Original single-meme search:
```bash
python search_meme_template.py "success kid"
```

2. Process a memes.json file:
```bash
python search_meme_template.py --json public/data/memes.json
```

The script will:
1. Keep existing image_urls that aren't placeholders
2. Download missing images to the downloaded_templates directory
3. Update the JSON with relative paths to the downloaded images
4. Use forward slashes in paths for cross-platform compatibility
5. Show detailed progress for each meme being processed

Would you like me to run it on your memes.json file?

---

_**User**_

actually, put the downloaded imags in the same directory as the provided json file

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the script to put the downloaded images in the same directory as the memes.json file. I'll update both the `process_memes_json` function and the `download_image` function to handle this.

I've made several changes to save the images alongside the JSON file:

1. Modified `download_image` to require an output directory parameter (no more default)

2. Updated `search_meme_template` to:
   - Take an optional output_dir parameter
   - Pass it through to download_image
   - Fall back to "downloaded_templates" only for single-meme searches

3. Updated `process_memes_json` to:
   - Get the absolute path of the JSON file's directory
   - Use that directory for saving images
   - Store just the filename in the JSON (not the full path)
   - This means the JSON will contain entries like:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Success Kid",
       "image_url": "success_kid.jpg"
     }
     ```
   Instead of:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Success Kid",
       "image_url": "downloaded_templates/success_kid.jpg"
     }
     ```

Now when you run:
```bash
python search_meme_template.py --json public/data/memes.json
```

The script will:
1. Save all images in the same directory as memes.json
2. Store just the filenames in the JSON
3. Keep everything nicely organized in one place

This makes it easier to reference the images from your web application since they'll be right next to the JSON file.

_**User**_

instead of 1 post and image per query, grab 3 and save them all in the directory and in the json

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the script to fetch and save the top 3 results for each meme, appending numbers to the filenames to distinguish them. I'll update both the search function and the JSON structure to handle multiple images per meme.

I've made several changes to handle multiple images per meme:

1. Modified the search function to:
   - Fetch 3 results instead of 1 (`limit=3` in the URL)
   - Return a list of results instead of a single result
   - Add a small delay between downloads
   - Number the filenames (e.g., `success_kid_1.jpg`, `success_kid_2.jpg`, etc.)

2. Updated the JSON structure to use `image_urls` array instead of single `image_url`:
```json
{
  "name": "Success Kid",
  "image_urls": [
    "success_kid_1.jpg",
    "success_kid_2.jpg",
    "success_kid_3.jpg"
  ]
}
```

3. Modified the download function to:
   - Accept an index parameter for numbering files
   - Create filenames like `name_1.jpg`, `name_2.jpg`, etc.

4. Updated the processing function to:
   - Handle arrays of URLs instead of single URLs
   - Check if any URL in the array is a placeholder
   - Save all downloaded images in the JSON's directory
   - Show better progress information for multiple downloads

5. Added more verbose output to show:
   - Which result number is being processed
   - Multiple download progress indicators
   - Clear separation between results

Now when you run:
```bash
python search_meme_template.py --json public/data/memes.json
```

It will:
1. Download up to 3 versions of each meme template
2. Save them with numbered filenames
3. Update the JSON to include all versions
4. Show detailed progress for each download

The script maintains all the same rate limiting and error handling, just applied to multiple images per meme.

_**User**_

for this script, when given a json, I want it to skip memes where "image_urls" is not an empty list.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the script to skip memes that already have image URLs, regardless of whether they contain "placeholder" or not. I'll update the check in the `process_memes_json` function.
